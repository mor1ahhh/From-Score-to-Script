## Overview
**From Score to Script** is a creative coding experiment that reimagines Toby Fox’s *“The Third Sanctuary”* using **Python** within the coding environment **TunePad**.
The project explores how musical structure can be translated into logical systems — loops, lists, and functions — transforming a traditional musical score into executable code. Every musical phrase, rhythm, and instrument has been reconstructed algorithmically to mirror the expressive complexity of the original piece.

This project was developed as part of a university assignment exploring **creative coding**.

## Features
- **Playable recreation** of “The Third Sanctuary” fully written in Python (TunePad environment)  
- **Nested loops** used to simulate musical structure and repetition  
- **Custom metre simulation** to mimic multiple time signatures (9/4, 11/8, 4/8, 10/8, 5/4, 12/8)  
- **Layered instrumentation** (melody, harmony, percussion)  
- **Mathematical rhythm control** using `playNote()` and `rests()` functions  

## Technologies Used
- **TunePad** (online music coding environment)
- **Python** syntax
- **MIDI playback engine** (built into TunePad)
- **GitHub** for version control and project sharing  

## How to Run
1. Open [TunePad](https://tunepad.com/) 
2. Go to **My Projects** and select **Import**  
3. Download the provided `.json` file.  
4. Upload the file (e.g. `from_score_to_script.json`) into TunePad.  
5. Press the ▶️ **Run/Play** button to hear the composition.  
6. **Optional:** For smoother playback, open the **Tracks** interface in TunePad and allow audio for each cell to generate to 100% — this ensures the playback runs smoothly without stuttering or delays.  
7. Once all audio has been generated, press **Run/Play** again to listen to the complete composition.  
8. **Alternative:** You can also listen to the composition via the uploaded `.mp3` file included in this repository. 

## Project Background
I wanted to merge my passion for **music** and **code** by reconstructing a complex song entirely through programming.  
Toby Fox’s *“The Third Sanctuary”* was chosen because of its challenging structure — frequent time signature changes and its layered instrumentation. I wanted to pick a piece that I would enjoy, but also have the capacity for me to experiment and learn new things through its recreation.
